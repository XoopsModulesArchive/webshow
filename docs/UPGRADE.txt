Instructions to Upgrade WebShow v.6* to v.71:
Backup your site and data base.

Upload the WebShow archive, overwriting all existing files.

Go to system admin - module admin and update the WebShow module.  
This may take a minute as the onupdate file adjusts the data base and deletes old files.

Empty public_html/template_c or xoopscache.  Leave the dummy index.html file.

Set the new module preference settings.

To display track and feed data visit each "Web Feed" entry and set Flash Variable "enablejs" then add track and feed to the entry info selections.
