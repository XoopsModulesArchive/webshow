WebShow v.71 Installation on XOOPS 2.0.* and 2.2.* Core 

Download the WebShow archive
Upload modules/webshow and uploads/webshow to xoops root
Open xoops Admin panel - system - modules and install the module. 
Set the module preferences, create a main category and add your media.

Color Picker:
Check class/xoopsform/ for a file named formcolorpicker.php, if it does not exist upload class/xoopsform/formcolorpicker.php from this archive.  
Open class/xoopsformloader.php and look for a line of code with include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH."/class/xoopsform/formcolorpicker.php, 
if it does not exist modify the existing file or upload the one from this archive.

*********************

Additional features:

To enable selectable HTML Text Editors, Captcha and Tags download and install the following additional files:

Frameworks - Provides many common functions for xoops modules such as Captcha confirmation and a generic object handler.
  Download the archive.  Extract.  Upload Frameworks directory to XOOPS_ROOT.  Done

xoops/class/xoopseditors - Allows selectable wysiwyg and DHTML editors.
  Download the archive. Extract.  Upload to Xoops_ROOT/class/.  Done.
  Modules equiped to use this class will now display selectable text editors in their preferences.

Install TAG Module v1.60 by phppp to enable tag functions that display linked keyword tags.
  Download.  Extract.  Upload to XOOPS_ROOT/modules/.  Goto admin panel system/modules and install the module.
  Xoops modules coded for TAGS will now have keyword input in their submit form and display a tagbar in their templates.

WebShow will run without these additional files but will not have Captcha Confirmation, Tags or Wysiwyg text editors.

**********************

Possible Conflict:

Problem:
The Modify Entry form is blank due to Text Body html editor class declaration.
If you have Frameworks/X22 and a xoopsformloader.php modified to include the text editor classes the Modify Entry Form may crash because these classes are also included by Framework/x22/xoopformloader.php.
This will cause a class redeclaration which crashes the modify form.

Solution:
Check xoops/class/xoopsformloader.php
if it includes the lines:
include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH."/class/xoopsform/formeditor.php";
include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH."/class/xoopsform/formselecteditor.php";
 
Then comment lines 515, 515, 517 in webshow/include/submitform.inc.php.

      // Comment OUT the next three lines if it conflicts with a modified xoopsformloader
      // if(file_exists(XOOPS_ROOT_PATH."/Frameworks/xoops22/class/xoopsformloader.php")) {
      //   !@include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH."/Frameworks/xoops22/class/xoopsformloader.php";
      // }
