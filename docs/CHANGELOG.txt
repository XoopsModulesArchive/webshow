Engaged the JW Player Config file variable.  Instead of showing numerous flash variables in the code boxes, the script 
calls config.php which generates an xml file containing the variables.  This hides the movies variables 
(including media file location) and cleans up the embed links.  Unfortunately, several variables are not working using config, 
this is a fault of the JW Player and should be resolved soon.
